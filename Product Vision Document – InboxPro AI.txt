InboxPro AI

❗️Problem Statement
Independent professionals like coaches, freelancers, consultants, and solopreneurs spend an overwhelming amount of time managing emails — writing proposals, following up on leads, replying to client messages, and scheduling meetings. Many lose leads or damage client trust due to slow responses, missed follow-ups, or poor email quality. They don’t have time to manage this manually, nor do they have the tools that fit their solo or small-team workflows.

Traditional email tools (Gmail, Outlook) are passive, and generic AI tools don’t cater to the specific needs of service providers whose revenue depends on communication speed and professionalism.

🎯 Target Users (Personas)
Freelancers – Designers, developers, marketers, content creators who frequently manage client communications.

Coaches – Career, fitness, business coaches who handle client onboarding, progress tracking, and lead generation via email.

Consultants – Legal, financial, and business consultants needing consistent professional communication.

Solopreneurs & Small Agencies – Individuals or micro-teams handling multiple clients but without full-time admin or sales support.

These users value time savings, professionalism, and client retention, and often rely heavily on Gmail or Google Workspace for day-to-day communication.
