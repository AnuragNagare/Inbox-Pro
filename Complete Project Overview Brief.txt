 InboxPro AI - Complete Project Overview Brief

 Project Summary

InboxPro AI is an intelligent email assistant designed specifically for coaches, freelancers, consultants, and service professionals. It's a web-based SaaS application that uses AI to help users manage emails more efficiently, respond faster to leads, and convert more prospects into paying clients.

 The Problem We're Solving

Service professionals spend 2-4 hours daily managing emails, often missing high-value leads due to slow response times. They struggle with:
- Writing professional emails quickly
- Prioritizing which emails need immediate attention
- Systematic follow-up with prospects
- Converting email inquiries into scheduled meetings
- Managing their inbox without feeling overwhelmed

These problems directly impact revenue - a coach missing just 2 potential clients monthly due to slow email responses could lose $5,000-15,000 annually.

 Our Solution

InboxPro AI transforms email management through AI-powered features:

1. AI Email Composition - Generate professional emails in seconds for any scenario (cold outreach, follow-ups, client updates)
2. Smart Reply Suggestions - Get 2-3 contextual response options for any incoming email
3. Lead Priority Scoring - AI analyzes emails and assigns Hot/Warm/Cold priority levels based on business potential
4. Follow-up Automation - Systematic scheduling and tracking of prospect follow-ups
5. Meeting Intent Detection - Automatically detect scheduling requests and suggest available times
6. Gmail Integration - Works seamlessly within existing Gmail workflow using OAuth 2.0
